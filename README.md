## üìÅ Folder /src
This section explains the content of the important folder `/src`.

* `/api/*`: This folder contains all endpoint handlers of the api. Its structure mirrors the path of the api endpoints to find the concurrent handler more easily.
* `/configuration/*`: Contains various configuration files which are loaded at the beginning to set up express, the logger or to validate the environment variables.
* `/routes/*`: This folder contains all routes/endpoints that the backend listens on. These files connect correlating endpoint handlers and their routes. Also these files configure requirements like authentication and authorization.
* `/schemas/*`: Contains database schema definitions for various collections like users or bookings.
